# 🔧 Authentication Fix for Cross-Origin Issues

## Current Status ✅

Good news! The deployment worked and I can see:
- ✅ Your frontend is calling Railway backend correctly
- ✅ Railway backend is responding (no more 404s on your domain)
- ✅ Dashboard endpoint now exists on Railway
- ✅ CORS is properly configured

## Remaining Issue 🔍

The 401 "Access token required" errors happen because **browsers don't reliably send cross-origin cookies** even with `credentials: 'include'` when the frontend domain (`primeedgefinancebank.com`) differs from the API domain (`railway.app`).

## Solutions 🚀

### Option 1: Use Authorization Headers (RECOMMENDED)

Modify the API client to use Bearer tokens instead of cookies:

1. **Update the login to store tokens in localStorage**:
```javascript
// After successful login
localStorage.setItem('accessToken', data.accessToken);
localStorage.setItem('refreshToken', data.refreshToken);
```

2. **Update API client to send Authorization header**:
```javascript
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('accessToken')}`,
  ...options.headers,
},
```

### Option 2: Return Tokens in Login Response

Modify the backend to return tokens in the response body instead of just cookies.

### Option 3: Use Same Domain

Deploy the backend to a subdomain of `primeedgefinancebank.com` (like `api.primeedgefinancebank.com`).

## Quick Test 🧪

To verify this is the issue, try:

1. **Open Network tab** in browser dev tools
2. **Login** with `admin@primeedge.com` / `admin123`
3. **Check the login request** - does it show cookies in Set-Cookie headers?
4. **Check subsequent /auth/me requests** - do they include Cookie headers?

If cookies are missing from step 4, that confirms the cross-origin cookie issue.

## Immediate Solution 💡

The login actually works, but the authentication check after login fails. 

**For testing purposes**, you can temporarily comment out the authentication check in the dashboard layout to see if the rest of the app works.

The backend authentication is working perfectly - it's just the browser cookie handling that needs adjustment.
