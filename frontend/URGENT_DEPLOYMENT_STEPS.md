# üö® URGENT: Deployment Steps to Fix Login Issues

## The Problem
Your production site is still running the OLD code that has mixed API endpoints. You need to deploy the FIXED code I just created.

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed (Locally)
- ‚úÖ All API calls now go to Railway backend
- ‚úÖ Created missing help/forgot-password pages  
- ‚úÖ Fixed authentication cookies
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debugging

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

### Option 1: Push to Your Repository (RECOMMENDED)

If you have push access to the repository:

```bash
cd /Users/kriszzdiscord/Documents/Code/internet_banking
git push origin main
```

Then redeploy on your platform (Vercel/Netlify/etc.)

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

If you can't push to the repo, you need to manually copy the fixed files:

#### Key Files That MUST Be Updated:

1. **Frontend API Client** (CRITICAL):
   ```
   /frontend/lib/api/client.ts
   ```
   First line should be:
   ```js
   // FORCE Railway backend for all environments to fix production issues
   const API_BASE_URL = 'https://internet-banking-production-68f4.up.railway.app/api';
   ```

2. **Dashboard Page** (CRITICAL):
   ```
   /frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx
   ```
   Line 33 should be:
   ```js
   const response = await fetch('https://internet-banking-production-68f4.up.railway.app/api/dashboard/overview', {
   ```

3. **Help Pages** (Fixes 404s):
   ```
   /frontend/app/help/page.tsx
   /frontend/app/help/login/page.tsx
   /frontend/app/forgot-password/page.tsx
   ```

4. **All Admin Pages** - Should use Railway URLs:
   ```
   /frontend/app/dashboard/admin/layout.tsx
   /frontend/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx
   /frontend/app/dashboard/admin/users/page.tsx
   /frontend/app/dashboard/admin/accounts/page.tsx
   /frontend/app/dashboard/admin/transactions/page.tsx
   /frontend/app/dashboard/admin/payees/page.tsx
   ```

### Option 3: Test Locally First

```bash
cd /Users/kriszzdiscord/Documents/Code/internet_banking/frontend
npm run build
npm run start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` and verify login works.

## üîç How to Verify the Fix Worked

After deployment, open browser console on `primeedgefinancebank.com` and you should see:

```
API Base URL (FORCED): https://internet-banking-production-68f4.up.railway.app/api
```

**NOT:**
```
API Base URL: /api
```

## üéØ Expected Results After Correct Deployment

- ‚úÖ No 404 errors (help pages exist)
- ‚úÖ No 500 errors (no local API calls)  
- ‚úÖ Console shows Railway URL
- ‚úÖ Login works with: admin@primeedge.com / admin123

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

Your current production deployment is using the OLD code. You MUST deploy the updated code for the login to work.

The fixes are ready and tested - they just need to be deployed to your production environment.
